# Counter 2.0

This is an updated version of the default Flutter Counter app. It includes several new features and enhancements, making it more interactive and visually appealing.

## Features

- Increment, Decrement, and Reset functionality: Easily increase, decrease, or reset the counter value with buttons.
- Editable Counter Value: Directly type in the desired value by tapping on the counter text.
- Animated Counter Value: Displayed with animations, the text size progressively adjusts and the color becomes redder as the value approaches the minimum or maximum boundary.
- Dark Mode: Supports a visually comfortable experience in low-light environments.

## Technical Implementations

- Custom State Management: Implemented using change notifiers and inherited widgets for efficient state updates and synchronized UI.
- Inherited Widgets: Utilized for data and state propagation, reducing code duplication and improving performance.
- Immutability: Ensured data integrity and predictability by implementing immutable classes.
- Reduced Primitive Obsession: Encapsulated related data and behavior within custom classes, improving code organization and reducing reliance on primitive types.

## Project Structure

This project follows clean coding practices and has been structured in a modular and maintainable manner. Here are some key considerations:

- Folder Structure: Features have been separated into folders, with model, view, and business logic each in their respective folders to promote organization and ease of navigation.
- Barrel Files: Utilized to simplify imports and provide easy access to multiple files within each feature folder.
